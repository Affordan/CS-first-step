Ok,here I have some thoughts of CS . To be honest , I am new to computer in university ! I even don't have my own computer and mobile phone before I went to unversity.
Actually , I even don't learn about what's a programming languange.So it's hard for me to learn a new things at first ,but I belive I can do it well in the days to come.
I'm a toatal new hand to computer. But luckily I found my interst in computer and the infinite world attracts me deeply. 
My first programming language is C which i s created by Ritchie. During the learning of C I learn about Linux which is written by C initially ,I was aborbed in exploring
Linux.This is the late interst and also learning C.
