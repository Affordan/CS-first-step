Hi,this month I learned much from my friends and konwledge of C++.
First of all I have learned all basic syntax of C++ including encapsulation,inheritance,polymophism and template,next stage I'm going to learn STL and review my professional courses!
And my Advanced mathematics course and Probility Theory and Mathematical statistic should also be valued.
