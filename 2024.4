Hello,welcome to my grown-up road.I'm a man who is addicted to characters,so it's quite enjoyable for me to coding or writing with my thoughts.
Well,I can't believe I have come to the end of this semester!My university life has passed a quarter ,amazing!
I'm learing C++ this semester.It's quite hard actually.But it attracts me deeply too.
I was addicted to the delicated concepts in C++ many times,such as class,inherit,template,STL,threads and more.
It's a new world from C.Besides I'm learning data structure and algorithm very hard cause I didn't won a prize in a simple constest which made my decision to learn it well!
If I have to say a word to the freshman who just step into the university, I would say "You boy're so lucky to meet a good trustworthy friend.She tought you many things by what she did and what she thought!"

Wish you better! All of you!
